Topic: Introduction to Natural Language Processing (NLP)

1- **Formal Definition:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding by providing computational techniques to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. NLP combines computational linguistics with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models. We can use NLP to:

*   **Understand:** Analyze the meaning and intent behind text, including sentiment, entities, and relationships.
*   **Generate:** Create new text that is coherent, grammatically correct, and contextually relevant.
*   **Translate:** Convert text from one language to another.
*   **Summarize:** Condense large documents into shorter, more manageable summaries.
*   **Classify:** Categorize text into predefined categories based on content.
*   **Extract:** Identify and extract specific information from text, such as names, dates, and locations.

2- **Application Scenario:**

Let's consider a **customer service chatbot** for an e-commerce website. This chatbot can use NLP to:

*   **Understand** the customer's query:  If a customer types "My order hasn't arrived yet," the chatbot uses NLP to understand that the customer is inquiring about the status of their order. This includes identifying keywords like "order" and "arrived." It might also perform sentiment analysis to detect frustration.
*   **Extract** relevant information: If the customer provides an order number ("Order #12345"), the chatbot extracts this information using NLP techniques like named entity recognition.
*   **Provide** a relevant response: Based on the understanding and extracted information, the chatbot can fetch the order status from the database and respond with "Your order #12345 is currently in transit and expected to arrive tomorrow."
*   **Generate** appropriate follow-up questions: If the order is delayed, the chatbot might generate a follow-up question like "Would you like me to contact the shipping carrier for more information?"

3- **Method to Apply in Python (Sentiment Analysis Example):**

We can use the `NLTK` (Natural Language Toolkit) or `spaCy` library for sentiment analysis in Python. Here's a basic example using NLTK and VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner):

```python
import nltk
from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Download necessary resources (run once)
nltk.download('vader_lexicon')
nltk.download('punkt') # Required by the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer

# Initialize the sentiment analyzer
sid = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()

# Example text
text = "This movie was absolutely fantastic! I highly recommend it."

# Get the sentiment scores
scores = sid.polarity_scores(text)

# Print the scores
print(scores)

# Determine the overall sentiment
if scores['compound'] >= 0.05:
    print("Positive sentiment")
elif scores['compound'] <= -0.05:
    print("Negative sentiment")
else:
    print("Neutral sentiment")

```

Explanation:

*   We import `nltk` and `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer`.
*   We download the necessary resources (`vader_lexicon` which contains sentiment scores for words and `punkt` for sentence tokenization).
*   We initialize the `SentimentIntensityAnalyzer`.
*   We provide example text to analyze.
*   `sid.polarity_scores(text)` returns a dictionary containing negative, neutral, positive, and compound scores. The compound score is a normalized score ranging from -1 (most extreme negative) to +1 (most extreme positive).
*   We then check the `compound` score to determine the overall sentiment.

4- **Follow-up Question:**

What are some of the limitations of using lexicon-based sentiment analysis (like VADER) compared to machine learning-based approaches, and how can these limitations be addressed?

5- **Schedule a ChatGPT Chat (Simulated):**

<h2 id="1-formal-definition-what-is-it-and-how-can-we-use-it">1) Formal definition (what is it, and how can we use it?)</h2>
<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that deals with the interaction between computers and human (natural) languages. It aims to enable computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language in a way that is both valuable and meaningful. It bridges the gap between human communication and computer understanding.</p>
<p>We can use NLP to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand:</strong> Analyze the meaning, intent, and sentiment behind text. This includes tasks like identifying entities (people, places, organizations), understanding the relationship between words in a sentence (syntactic analysis), and extracting the overall meaning (semantic analysis).</li>
<li><strong>Generate:</strong> Create new text that is coherent, grammatically correct, and contextually relevant. This includes tasks like machine translation, text summarization, and chatbot development.</li>
<li><strong>Process:</strong> Transform and manipulate text to make it suitable for various tasks. This includes tasks like tokenization, stemming, lemmatization, and part-of-speech tagging.</li>
<li><strong>Reason:</strong> Drawing inferences from the given text and applying external knowledge to answer questions, summarize documents, or provide recommendations.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ultimately, NLP aims to make human-computer interaction more natural and intuitive.</p>
<h2 id="2-application-scenario">2) Application scenario</h2>
<p><strong>Sentiment analysis of customer reviews:</strong> Imagine an e-commerce company that wants to understand how customers feel about their products. They can use NLP to analyze thousands of customer reviews and automatically determine whether each review expresses positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. This allows the company to quickly identify products with customer satisfaction issues, track changes in customer sentiment over time, and prioritize areas for improvement. This is far more efficient than manually reading and categorizing reviews.</p>
<h2 id="3-python-method-if-possible">3) Python method (if possible)</h2>
<p>We can use the <code>NLTK</code> (Natural Language Toolkit) library for various NLP tasks. Here's an example of tokenizing a sentence using <code>NLTK</code>:</p>
<pre class="codehilite"><code class="language-python">import nltk
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize

nltk.download('punkt')  # Download the punkt tokenizer models (required for word_tokenize)

sentence = &quot;This is a simple sentence for NLP example.&quot;
tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)

print(tokens)
</code></pre>

<p>This code snippet first imports the <code>nltk</code> library and the <code>word_tokenize</code> function. It then downloads the 'punkt' resource which is needed for tokenizing.  The <code>word_tokenize</code> function splits the sentence into individual words (tokens), and the code then prints the list of tokens.</p>
<h2 id="4-follow-up-question">4) Follow-up question</h2>
<p>Given that NLP relies on large amounts of text data for training, how can we address the issue of bias in the training data to ensure fairness and prevent discriminatory outcomes in NLP applications?</p>
